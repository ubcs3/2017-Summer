## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science.

### Summer 2017: Practical Deep Learning (following course.fast.ai)

#### OUTLINE

* What are the **learning goals**?
  * To learn the basics of neural networks and deep learning
  * To learn the basics of [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) (or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/))
  * To train neural networks on GPU servers hosted by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  * To meet and collaborate with other students and faculty interested in scientific computing
* What **software tools** are we going to use?
  * [Keras](https://keras.io/): high-level neural networks API
  * [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/)/[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): numerical computation on GPUs
  * [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/): cloud computing with Amazon Web Services
  * [SciPy Stack](http://scipy.org/): scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
* What **scientific topics** will we study?
  * Neural networks and deep learning following [course.fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/)
* Where do we start? What are the **prerequisites**?
  * UBCS3 Summer 2017 is a continuation of [UBCS3 Winter 2017](https://github.com/ubcs3/2017-Winter):
    * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen
* Who is the target **audience**?
  * Everyone is invited!
  * If the outline above is at your level, perfect! Get ready to write a lot of code!
  * If the outline above seems too intimidating, come anyway! You'll learn things just by being exposed to new tools and ideas, and meeting new people!
  * If you have experience with all the topics outlined above, come anyway! You'll become more of an expert by participating as a helper/instructor!
